<i>"Winner, winner,
chicken dinner."</i>

2
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,703
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,080
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore,
that phrase.</i>

4
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:02,286
<i>Just ask any of the old-time
pit bosses, they'll know.</i>

5
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:09,962
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,699
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,258
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,361
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
There it is!</i>

9
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,838
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,442
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:29,705
<i>I had heard it at least
14 times that night.</i>

12
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,941
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,120
<i>First of all, what
I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,452
<i>There were certain institutions
and people that frowned upon it,</i>

15
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,720
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:43,591
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,997
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:51,129
<i>That's what got me
into all this mess.</i>

20
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:56,732
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over 640,000 dollars.</i>

21
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,603
All right! I'm just gonna have
to split those tens.

22
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:04,444
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.

23
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,519
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

24
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,610
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

25
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,882
<i>Folded arms,
the table's hot.</i>

26
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:14,450
<i>A touch to the eye,
we need to talk.</i>

27
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:20,325
<i>And a hand, running through
perfect flowing hair, meant only one thing.</i>

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,661
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

TA to Professors Wilkins
and Sanders.

37
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:27,382
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

38
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:30,513
And you're accepted early into school
here at Harvard Med,

39
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,558
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

40
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,626
Thank you.

41
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,958
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

42
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:41,500
It's a free ride. And
free rides don't come easy.

43
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,590
Absolutely.

44
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:47,799
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

45
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:51,502
and most of whom have r�sum�s
just as impressive as yours.

46
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:53,605
Right.

47
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:56,375
Uh, Professor Phillips?

48
00:05:56,568 --> 00:06:00,585
Uh, some kids... grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

49
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:04,645
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

50
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:10,151
I grew up, uh... Well, really, I just
wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

51
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:16,861
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

52
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,028
Which I don't really have.

53
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:26,037
So, what-what I'm trying to say

54
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:30,479
is that I really, really
need this scholarship.

55
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,915
Did you rehearse that?

56
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:38,388
Yeah. Like, 14 times
in front of the mirror.

57
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:43,426
Unfortunately, desire
doesn't figure into this much.

58
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,665
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who...

59
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,431
dazzles.

60
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:56,064
Somebody who just...
jumps off the page.

61
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:00,978
Oh, well, then, uh, I'm also
involved in a science competition.

62
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,809
We're building a robotic wheel

63
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:07,113
that can navigate itself, uh,
using a proprietary GPS system.

64
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,321
Well, I'm designing
the system. So...

65
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,550
Right.

66
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:16,493
Ben, last year, the Robinson
went to Hyum Jae Wook,

67
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:19,565
a Korean immigrant
who has only one leg.

68
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,763
Well, I-I have both my legs.

69
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,998
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

70
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:29,865
That was a joke.

71
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,777
Ben, it's all about the essay.

72
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,871
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

73
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,315
What life experience separates
you from all the rest.

74
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,911
Life experience.

75
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,718
What can you tell me, Ben,

76
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:47,452
that's going
to dazzle me?

77
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,309
I'm so sorry
I'm late.

78
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,684
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

79
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,350
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

80
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,860
Congratulations.
How does 8 dollars an hour sound?

81
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,430
Eight dollars?

82
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:30,800
Wow! Wow. That's-that's great,
Warren. Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,701
You slept with him,
didn't you?

84
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,036
- Uhh, yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:40,460
- Yes, I did.
- I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour.

86
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:43,741
So, Palmer finishes up his lecture,
right? And I say to him,

87
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,580
" Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes

88
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,780
" to get the kind of results
that you're looking for, okay?"

89
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,825
So, then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"

90
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:59,023
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

91
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,396
" You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

92
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:08,302
Oh, my God. What the hell
is wrong with you?

93
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,140
Huh? Oh, nothing.

94
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:14,744
I hope nothing. You just got
promoted, man. You should be happy.

95
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:19,978
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

96
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,116
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

97
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:27,920
- Oh, gimme a break, Ben.
- What?

98
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,756
You've everything.

99
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:34,622
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

100
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:35,996
Yeah, well,
it doesn't dazzle.

101
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:38,366
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

102
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,403
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

103
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:44,874
I-I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

104
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:47,878
I even sat up at the front
and I stayed late.

105
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,948
Man, I gave up everything.

106
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,716
You know, I gave up fun.
I gave up sex.

107
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:54,479
I don't think
you gave up sex.

108
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,817
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

109
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:58,617
All right, all right.
Not sex, but...

110
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,715
It just annoys me
that the one thing

111
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:03,761
that is stopping me from
going to Harvard Med is money.

112
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:08,095
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over 300,000 dollars.

113
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,993
300,000 dollars.

114
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,402
It's outrageous. It's-it's-it's
astronomically high. I get that.

115
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:18,409
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

116
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,974
Well, look at the bright side,

117
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:26,645
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

118
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:38,056
Thank you.

119
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,925
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, mom.

120
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:44,332
Thank you, love.
Kisses.

121
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,665
Make a wish.

122
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,068
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

123
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,407
Bravo.

124
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:51,840
Congratulations, Benjamin.

125
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,742
Did you know Miles did the frosting
on that? You see that?

126
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,010
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

127
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:01,109
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

128
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,744
Cam, you owe
another six bucks.

129
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,482
No, no. I didn't eat
any of the Buffalo wings.

130
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,058
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

131
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,423
We're just dividing equally.
So, let's say you pay.

132
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,554
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

133
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:15,862
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

134
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,903
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

135
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:22,371
So, I nailed the specs
on the 2.09 last night,

136
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,841
after 19 cups of coffee.

137
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:27,970
Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

138
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,240
This is good.
Miles, this is-this is good.

139
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,583
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

140
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:38,020
This is called destiny.

141
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,921
You know, there is the poss...
Thank you.

142
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,688
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

143
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:47,197
Oh, yeah? Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!

144
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,597
Look, guys,

145
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:56,333
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

146
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,002
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

147
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,449
If we can't even win that,
what's the point?

148
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:08,954
Hey, hey. Look at this!

149
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,149
No, no, no, no.

150
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,457
-Yeah.
- We... suck.

151
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:28,068
Your father would be
so proud of you, Ben.

152
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:30,867
Yeah.

153
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:35,246
Do you remember
anything about him?

154
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:40,015
Not really.
Maybe... when he shaved?

155
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,252
Yeah, I think
I watched him shave.

156
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:48,254
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

157
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,091
I don't know. I'll probably just
go back and work on that essay.

158
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,166
Ben, you're working
too hard.

159
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:58,965
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just... yourself.

160
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,871
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

161
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:07,002
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

162
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:09,342
Okay. All right.

163
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,310
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

164
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,285
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

165
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,353
All right.

166
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,056
Now, who can explain Newton's
method and how you use it?

167
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:30,058
Uh, you can use it
to solve nonlinear equations.

168
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:35,395
That's impressive. That's-that's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

169
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:38,999
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

170
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,337
All right, now somebody tell me
something I don't already know.

171
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,575
Anyone?

172
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:47,243
Bueller. Anyone?
Bueller.

173
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,479
Newton stole it.

174
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,582
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

175
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,861
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

176
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,899
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then... it fails.

177
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:06,797
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

178
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:07,930
Ben.

179
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,873
So, Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

180
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,671
was the original author
of this method.

181
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,871
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

182
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,211
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

183
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,682
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

184
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:26,349
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

185
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,655
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

186
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:34,165
We're gonna call this, um,
the game show host problem, all right?

187
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:36,291
Ben, suppose you're
on a game show.

188
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:39,894
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

189
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:44,908
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

190
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,410
Which door
would you choose, Ben?

191
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,870
Uh, door number one?

192
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:50,778
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

193
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,874
All right, now,
the game show host,

194
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:55,954
who, by the way, knows
what's behind all the other doors,

195
00:14:56,055 --> 00:15:00,253
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

196
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:04,260
Behind which sits a goat.
Now...

197
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,160
Ben, game show host
comes up to you.

198
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:08,665
He says, " Ben, do you wanna
stay with door number one

199
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,098
" or go with door
number two?"

200
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:13,660
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

201
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,864
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

202
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,068
Remember, the host knows
where the car is

203
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:20,611
so, how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

204
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,580
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

205
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:27,914
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

206
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,988
Based on variable change.

207
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,522
Variable change? But he just
asked you a simple question.

208
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,889
Yeah, which changed everything.

209
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,526
Enlighten us.

210
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:40,894
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,458
I had a 33.3% chance
of choosing right.

212
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:48,667
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

213
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:52,972
it's now 66.7%
if I choose to switch.

214
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:58,778
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

215
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:02,513
Exactly.

216
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,815
People, remember,

217
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:08,154
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

218
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,353
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

219
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:13,954
out of paranoia,
fear, emotions.

220
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,967
But Mr. Campbell,
he kept emotions aside

221
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:23,899
and let simple math get
his ass into a brand-new car!

222
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:27,271
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

223
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,437
All right, everybody.

224
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:29,946
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

225
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,607
Your graded papers are
down here at the end.

226
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,242
You can pick them
up on your way out.

227
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:46,324
I am invincible.

228
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:55,763
Guys, Jill Taylor,
10 o'clock.

229
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,387
Oh, man.
That's brutal.

230
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,493
You know, you should
just ask her out, man.

231
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:20,087
It's not like she's a rocket
scientist or anything.

232
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,791
Oh, wait, she is.

233
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,959
Well, why don't
you ask her?

234
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:27,731
Because... I'm, uh,
I'm already dating someone.

235
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,631
Yeah, your right hand
doesn't count, Miles.

236
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:34,041
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

237
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,740
Hey, you know what? Maybe
I don't even wanna go out with her.

238
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,250
Yeah, that's funny.

239
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:48,188
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

240
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,894
Well, I'd say getting down
with that would definitely qualify.

241
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:54,893
Cam!

242
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,587
Boy genius.

243
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,515
You have
to follow me now.

244
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:23,587
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

245
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,790
Come on.

246
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,171
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

247
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:54,052
Oh... our honored guest.

248
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,857
How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

249
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,727
- You ever been in this room before?
- Uh, yeah.

250
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,831
Organic Chemistry
in my freshman year.

251
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,427
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

252
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,602
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

253
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,611
Is there... a problem
with my paper?

254
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:18,911
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

255
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:22,646
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

256
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:27,748
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

257
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,220
So, is this some kind
of a math club?

258
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't be rude, people.

259
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,860
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

260
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,561
- Choi.
- Jill.

261
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,504
- You ever studied, uh, blackjack?
- Uh, no.

262
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:48,038
No, really? Well,
it's really simple, actually.

263
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,239
You play against the dealer.

264
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,507
You're given two cards.

265
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,882
Face cards are worth 10 points.

266
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,046
The closest to 21 wins.

267
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:01,020
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

268
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,362
It's the most popular
card game in the world.

269
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:06,692
It's a game with memory.

270
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,494
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

271
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,331
And the best part,
it's beatable.

272
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:16,801
Are you talking
about counting cards?

273
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:21,504
No. I'm talking about
getting very, very rich.

274
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:27,174
You-you count cards,
right? All of you?

275
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:28,776
As a team, yes.

276
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:32,545
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

277
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:36,155
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

278
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,956
So, why are you
telling me?

279
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,897
Well, let's just say a spot
opened up on our roster.

280
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,026
How?

281
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,728
Jimmy got
a job at Google.

282
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,275
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

283
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,206
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

284
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:56,611
Ben, I said Google,
not Sizzler.

285
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,711
Yeah... This is crazy.

286
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:02,514
No, Ben.
This is profitable.

287
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,054
Yeah, I-I can't do it.
So, I'm sorry.

288
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,096
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

289
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,755
No, it's not that.
It's...

290
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:18,802
I just got a promotion at my job,
so, it's kind of not a good time for me.

291
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,371
We pay better.

292
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:23,801
Look, I can't-I can't just
go to Vegas on weekends.

293
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,538
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

294
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,807
I mean, what do you
have to worry about?

295
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:33,976
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

296
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:39,615
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

297
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:42,221
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

298
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:46,426
Wait, no. I-I'm building
a car that drives by itself.

299
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:49,364
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

300
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:51,493
so, it's kind of important.

301
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:55,437
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

302
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:03,637
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also... composed.

303
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,374
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

304
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:12,656
Ben, you were born for this.

305
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,855
You'll have more fun than
you've ever had in your entire life.

306
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,360
It's perfect.

307
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:23,066
Thank you. Um, but I'm...
really not the right guy.

308
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,569
So, I'm sorry.

309
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:33,570
Ben.

310
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:37,313
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

311
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,111
- No, of...
- No.

312
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,378
You're one of
my favorite new students,

313
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,717
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

314
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,628
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

315
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:56,565
It's boxy. It's blue.
How is that not you?

316
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:58,863
So, how much is this thing
gonna run me?

317
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,169
Oh, well, uh, let's see, the belt's
49.95, minus 15%.

318
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:06,938
The jacket's 589.99.

319
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:10,606
The pants are 285.99,
minus 10% for both.

320
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:14,981
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the 69.99.

321
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:17,213
The shoes were just
marked down from 155,

322
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:22,885
so you're looking at
1,042 dollars and 68 cents.

323
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,361
I'm pretty good
with numbers.

324
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:31,695
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

325
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:34,101
Yeah, so, let me know when
I can ring that up for you guys.

326
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,340
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,102
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

328
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:42,437
Hey.

329
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,241
Hey.

330
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:50,387
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

331
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,521
I-I'm looking for a tie.

332
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:58,028
Oh, well, we're having
a 15% sale on the ties.

333
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:02,756
And if you want, I could
probably get you an additional 10%

334
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,893
with my...
my employee discount.

335
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:08,505
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

336
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:15,206
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

337
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:19,374
you know, to-to repel
liquids and stains.

338
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:24,012
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

339
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:26,657
Face me. Stay still.

340
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:32,060
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

341
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:37,725
I'm actually...
not here for a tie, Ben.

342
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:41,932
I came to see you.

343
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,435
You did?

344
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:48,042
Blackjack's a great game.

345
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,773
No, look,
it's easy to learn

346
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:53,681
and there's really not as much strategy
to it as people think.

347
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,876
I grew up on it, actually.

348
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,423
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

349
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,757
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

350
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:07,487
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

351
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:11,093
If I won, he'd take me out
for ice cream.

352
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:13,067
And... what if he won?

353
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:16,696
He'd still take me out
for ice cream.

354
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:20,141
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah,
he's your dad.

355
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,512
Ben, you should feel
the thrill

356
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:29,714
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

357
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,957
I think you should come to Vegas

358
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:42,466
'cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

359
00:25:48,206 --> 00:25:49,400
I can't.

360
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,607
I'm sorry.

361
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:54,144
I just can't.

362
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,714
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

363
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:01,578
Yeah.

364
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,219
You're welcome any time.

365
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:12,094
You know, I think
the best thing about Vegas

366
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:15,265
is you can become
anyone you want.

367
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:45,990
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

368
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:47,064
- No.
- Plus 11.

369
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:48,154
No.

370
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:51,299
- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."

371
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,802
- Uh, plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

372
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:56,067
People, please. We had a total
of 76 cards that came out of the deck.

373
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:58,301
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

374
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,503
Seventeen were neutral
with no value at all,

375
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:02,341
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

376
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,075
How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

377
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:10,112
The count. It's plus 13.

378
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,683
Yes.

379
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,452
Pull up a chair.

380
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:26,228
Stop.

381
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:29,769
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

382
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,842
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

383
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:34,236
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

384
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:35,403
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

385
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:36,480
Cat.

386
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,646
Plus 16.

387
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:39,314
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

388
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:41,677
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

389
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,882
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

390
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,480
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

391
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:50,857
Plus 13. Plus 8.
Plus 9. Plus 12.

392
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:54,665
<i>I was studying
all day, every day.</i>

393
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:59,226
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

394
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:02,397
<i>used in ways I could
never have imagined.</i>

395
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,172
<i>The team had a system.</i>

396
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:09,945
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

397
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:14,310
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

398
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:16,053
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

399
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,178
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

400
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:19,085
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

401
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:20,686
Plus 12.

402
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,885
Uh, is this chemistry review?

403
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:29,290
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

404
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,526
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

405
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,000
Use it in a sentence.

406
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:34,367
Man, that sugar's sweet.

407
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,569
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

408
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,201
<i>That's how
I knew what to bet.</i>

409
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:43,007
You're doing great.

410
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:49,081
Micky, I... I just wanna let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

411
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,212
which is 300,000.

412
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:54,985
I mean, if I can get anything
close to that, then I'm done.

413
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,525
Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if", it's " when".

414
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,292
And second of all, I get it.
I completely understand.

415
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:04,027
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

416
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:07,400
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

417
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:10,872
so, who knows how long
this gig's gonna last for any of us?

418
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:12,704
Well, what if we get caught?

419
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:15,871
Our system keeps us
under the radar, you'll see.

420
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,642
Anyway, counting cards
isn't illegal.

421
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:24,011
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

422
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:30,292
You think you can
beat the system?

423
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:35,063
This is the system,
beating you back.

424
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:40,964
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

425
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:45,371
Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

426
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,034
Count to five.

427
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,841
Count to five!
- What?

428
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,585
Count to five, so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

429
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:55,812
Start with one.

430
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,514
One, two, three, four, five.

431
00:29:58,623 --> 00:30:02,821
Good. Now, stop counting.

432
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:07,725
Let's go.

433
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,870
You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.

434
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,030
My grandmother splits eights.

435
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:17,699
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.

436
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:19,436
Look, you're choosing
to play two hands

437
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:21,661
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

438
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:24,205
- Right, and...
- Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

439
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:26,374
Against a 10 or an ace,
it's a sucker play.

440
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:29,112
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

441
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,518
Choi, why don't you explain
to Ben how we do?

442
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,988
Oh, all right.

443
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:36,527
So, uh, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

444
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,345
spotters and big players, right?
- Yeah.

445
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:42,222
So, if you think that this...
this table is the casino floor, then, um...

446
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:45,860
salt 'n' pepper shakers
are your spotters. All right.

447
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,735
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

448
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,173
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

449
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:55,269
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

450
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,110
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

451
00:30:58,216 --> 00:31:01,276
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

452
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,946
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

453
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,784
Right. And then when one
of the decks gets hot,

454
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,381
the spotter at that table
signals in the big player.

455
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,927
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

456
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:13,088
Well, I'm always
the mustard, so...

457
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:17,361
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

458
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:21,370
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

459
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:24,168
So, the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

460
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,470
When the deck cools,
he cashes in.

461
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,067
It's not as easy as it sounds.

462
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:29,612
Oh, yeah, it's not,
you know,

463
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:32,342
because if Grey Poupon
over here ever loses the count,

464
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,283
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

465
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:37,980
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

466
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:39,280
Show us.

467
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,789
Okay, what's this?

468
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:43,292
- Uh, the deck's hot.
- Right.

469
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,259
Uh, we need to talk.

470
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:47,925
The deck's cooling.

471
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:51,194
And get out.
Get out now.

472
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,000
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

473
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,972
There's a trial run?

474
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,374
- Where?
- You'll find out.

475
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,525
Hey.

476
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,014
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:16,683
Follow me.

478
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,224
This way.

479
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,866
Go, go. You go.

480
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,852
No more bet.
No more bet.

481
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,887
Come on, money.

482
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,794
Today, 14.

483
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:03,662
Whose side are you on?

484
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:13,203
Sixteen.

485
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:15,404
Thank you.
Sorry, gentlemen.

486
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:21,178
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

487
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:33,653
You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. 300.

488
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,025
$300.

489
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:46,469
300.

490
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:49,212
You bet, sir?

491
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:52,344
Thanks.

492
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,166
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

493
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:18,240
" Winner, winner,
chicken dinner." All right.

494
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:22,574
Nice.

495
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:29,015
Can I get, uh...
Can I another drink, please?

496
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,617
Thank you.

497
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:35,222
What the hell are you doing?

498
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:38,454
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

499
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:40,190
Get off, I haven't done
anything!

500
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,927
Please.
Please, let go.

501
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:45,832
- What's the count?
- Please, don't hurt me.

502
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,303
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

503
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:49,964
What's the count?

504
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:54,068
Plus 18.

505
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,908
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding.

506
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,178
Congratulations, Ben.

507
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,516
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

508
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,385
Welcome to the team.

509
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:09,086
We didn't mean it.

510
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:12,128
It's okay, Campbell,
I cried inside that bag.

511
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:23,701
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

512
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:26,106
I want you to take
Jimmy's place.

513
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:28,643
I've never done this.

514
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:29,974
I know that
and I understand.

515
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:33,209
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

516
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,478
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

517
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:37,383
and I've never had
a student as impressive as you.

518
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,718
Your brain is like
a goddamn Pentium chip.

519
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,349
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

520
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,293
'Cause you remind me
of myself 25 years ago.

521
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,690
You in?

522
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:52,300
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

523
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,401
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

524
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:02,007
We're counting cards,
we're not gambling.

525
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:05,340
We're following a specific set
of rules and playing a system.

526
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:06,438
Right.

527
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,575
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

528
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,587
and, sometimes,
people lose control.

529
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:14,184
They give in
to their emotions.

530
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,892
You will not.

531
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:19,653
You understand?

532
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:21,822
Yeah.

533
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:24,734
Get some rest.

534
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,394
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

535
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:31,134
Tomorrow? I-I-I have a Quantitative
Literacy paper due Tuesday.

536
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:33,668
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

537
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:35,643
No, I spoke
to Professor O'Reilly.

538
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:37,907
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

539
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:40,643
and he understood,
so, uh, he gave you an A.

540
00:37:41,852 --> 00:37:45,344
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

541
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,050
You'll get a call
about details later.

542
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:52,228
So, did the girls
go on ahead, huh?

543
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,662
Oh, yeah. They got a lot
more bags to check, you know?

544
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:55,823
Okay.

545
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,834
Well, wait for us by security 'cause
Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

546
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:00,028
No, I'm good.

547
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:02,469
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

548
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:05,440
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

549
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,308
Honestly, I-I really
don't have to go.

550
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,991
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I-I really don't have...

551
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:13,965
Shut up, please,
just shut up.

552
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:16,315
What are you doin'? Why-why are you
looking over there? Look, I don't...

553
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,513
I don't care.
Shut up. Get in here.

554
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:20,817
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

555
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:24,256
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

556
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,991
Don't ask questions.

557
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,827
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

558
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,269
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

559
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:40,101
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

560
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,338
And we're not about
to have them confiscate 250,000.

561
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,175
250,000?

562
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:48,244
No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

563
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:51,548
You really suck at
not asking questions.

564
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,589
What's a donkey boy?

565
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:01,494
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

566
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:05,663
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

567
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,399
Act casual, think casual,
be casual.

568
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:12,203
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

569
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,640
Thank you.

570
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:19,208
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

571
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,669
Your boarding pass.

573
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,719
Sir?

574
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:20,071
You forgot your bag.

575
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,877
Oh. Thanks.

576
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,128
Nice going, Campbell.

577
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:29,899
Hey, Ben. Basic strategy
says you should, uh, hit that.

578
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:45,115
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

579
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:48,419
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

580
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,516
So glad you could make it.

581
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:52,626
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

582
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,028
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

583
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:56,292
You live in Washington, D.C.

584
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,166
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

585
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,534
- I-I don't like my name.
- Why not?

586
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,734
" Sierra Sommers."
Do I look like a Sierra?

587
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:08,038
Well, you have a lot of
clever outfits. You'll figure it out.

588
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:11,308
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

589
00:43:11,415 --> 00:43:14,612
You know, I-I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

590
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:16,948
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

591
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:19,750
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

592
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:22,121
and it allows everyone to be
different people in different casinos.

593
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:26,253
Hey! You steal the Bible,
you go to hell. That's the way it works.

594
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:28,062
Like I'm not going already.

595
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:29,257
Yeah. All right.
Now, listen.

596
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:32,301
Ben, this is for you. All the casinos
have cameras in the ceiling.

597
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:33,768
They're called "eyes in the sky".

598
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:36,806
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

599
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,398
and, at all times,
you don't know each other.

600
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,810
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

601
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,141
Oh, and what's our motto?

602
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,184
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

603
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:49,980
Thank you very much.

604
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:52,613
How come
you don't play?

605
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:55,920
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

606
00:43:56,026 --> 00:43:58,927
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

607
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:00,621
Welcome to Vegas.

608
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:12,000
No more bets.

609
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:13,940
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

610
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:17,104
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

611
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:19,944
Oh, see, now that sounds
really complicated.

612
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,211
I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

613
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,981
Here to double
my family's inheritance.

614
00:44:26,757 --> 00:44:28,247
I don't know.

615
00:44:48,011 --> 00:44:49,478
10,000.

616
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:52,381
Changing 10,000.

617
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:54,348
Sweet. Too sweet.

618
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:17,632
<i>Eight. The count's
still plus 16.</i>

619
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:21,211
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

620
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,172
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

621
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:27,175
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

622
00:45:28,752 --> 00:45:30,720
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

623
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:35,351
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

624
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:38,757
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

625
00:45:39,062 --> 00:45:40,086
Can I split those?

626
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:43,189
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

627
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,932
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

628
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:58,679
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

629
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:07,755
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

630
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:16,255
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

631
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:19,326
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

632
00:46:19,803 --> 00:46:21,168
<i>Blackjack.</i>

633
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:08,383
Monkey! Monkey!

634
00:47:08,485 --> 00:47:10,385
- So, what's a monkey?
- Face card.

635
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:13,888
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

636
00:47:17,427 --> 00:47:18,587
Monkey!

637
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:20,361
Monkey! Come on,
give us a monkey!

638
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:23,627
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

639
00:47:23,734 --> 00:47:25,224
Monkey! Monkey!

640
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:30,403
All right, all right.

641
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:36,139
Oh, God.

642
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:38,805
I need to quit.

643
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:45,780
Uh, could I color up,
please?

644
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:30,064
Nice undies.

645
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:38,631
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

646
00:48:38,742 --> 00:48:40,573
We split it fiveways.

647
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,511
So, what do you think?

648
00:48:47,617 --> 00:48:49,244
Yeah, it was fun.

649
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:51,153
- You were good.
- Really?

650
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:54,690
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

651
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,750
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

652
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:03,055
And you made
more money than Fisher.

653
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,893
Yeah, I was... I was
pretty nervous, actually.

654
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:09,972
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of... easy.

655
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:13,299
Not for everyone.

656
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,537
Yeah, it's just simple math.

657
00:49:16,113 --> 00:49:19,014
Good. We can do
some serious damage with you.

658
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:26,753
Uhm... Here's the thing...
here's the thing I told Micky.

659
00:49:27,157 --> 00:49:31,355
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

660
00:49:31,461 --> 00:49:34,123
You know, 300,000 dollars
and then I'm out.

661
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:38,793
That's what they all say.

662
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:43,198
No, really, I mean, I'm just
doing this to pay for Harvard.

663
00:49:43,306 --> 00:49:45,774
It's... just a means
to an end for me.

664
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:49,111
I believe you.

665
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:50,671
Good.

666
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:03,951
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

667
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:06,751
Team meeting.

668
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,458
Hello?

669
00:50:08,565 --> 00:50:09,827
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,667
Where's everybody else?

671
00:50:11,768 --> 00:50:14,532
I don't know.
Fisher was right behind us.

672
00:50:18,508 --> 00:50:20,635
Oh, Fisher,
you didn't sleep.

673
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:25,471
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

674
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:29,611
She's a dancer.
I pulled her out of Sapphire.

675
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:34,590
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

676
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,092
Where's Kianna?

677
00:50:37,394 --> 00:50:38,554
Slots.

678
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,028
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

679
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:47,065
I've been busy this morning.

680
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:51,873
All right, guys,
let's get something clear.

681
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:54,205
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

682
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:56,711
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

683
00:50:56,813 --> 00:50:58,804
Kianna,
slots are for losers.

684
00:50:58,915 --> 00:51:01,076
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

685
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:02,442
Choi?
- Hmm?

686
00:51:02,752 --> 00:51:06,916
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

687
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:10,823
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

688
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:14,988
But, Fisher, what the hell
were you up to last night?

689
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:16,389
What?

690
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,492
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

691
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:20,797
but you kept on anyway.

692
00:51:20,904 --> 00:51:22,496
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

693
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:24,540
In either case, I don't wanna
see it happen again.

694
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:26,506
Jill, nice disguise last night.

695
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:31,274
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

696
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:33,338
Beginner's luck.

697
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,442
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man,
lose like a man.

698
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,079
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

699
00:51:39,189 --> 00:51:40,520
You know what's worse
than a loser?

700
00:51:40,624 --> 00:51:43,855
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

701
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,825
Take it up with Ida.

702
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,258
Who's Ida?

703
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:50,757
Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

704
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:52,858
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

705
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:21,787
There goes that paycheck.

706
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:32,640
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

707
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:37,813
How's she...
how's she doing?

708
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:39,512
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

709
00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:42,517
The way I see it, yesterday's
history, tomorrow's a mystery.

710
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:45,417
It's all what you do
in the moment, baby.

711
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:59,626
Just lost another property.

712
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:04,105
- Who is it this time, Caesar's or the Mirage?
- Caesar's.

713
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:07,768
That was a 14-year account.

714
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:12,047
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

715
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:17,642
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

716
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:20,552
Okay, Clark, I'll, uh,
take a look at the tape.

717
00:53:20,757 --> 00:53:24,193
By the way, you, uh,
wanna lose the cigarette?

718
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:28,654
There's no smoking in here,
you know that.

719
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:36,328
I appreciate it.

720
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:44,981
End of an era,
my friend.

721
00:53:54,224 --> 00:53:56,055
Ben. Time for school.

722
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:02,057
I seem to keep
waking up to you.

723
00:54:02,165 --> 00:54:03,826
Don't get used to it.

724
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:25,310
I'm glad you came over
this morning.

725
00:54:26,456 --> 00:54:29,425
I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

726
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:33,920
I want you to have this.

727
00:54:34,631 --> 00:54:35,893
What's this?

728
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:43,335
That's a lot of money.

729
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,469
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

730
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:51,911
I know it won't pay
the whole way, but it should help.

731
00:54:53,216 --> 00:54:56,083
Ma, I can't take this.

732
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:58,713
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

733
00:54:58,822 --> 00:55:03,623
For precisely this reason. I wanna help
pay for med school, dr. Campbell.

734
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:11,664
Well, you know what?
You don't have to.

735
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:15,204
'Cause, uh, I got
the Robinson scholarship.

736
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:18,497
Yep, they're gonna pay
the whole way.

737
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:22,842
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because... I wanted it to be a surprise.

738
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:25,141
And, actually,
I just found out today.

739
00:55:25,248 --> 00:55:28,639
- I can't believe it! Oh, my God!
- I know.

740
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,983
This is amazing.
I am so proud of you.

741
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:39,990
I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

742
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:44,590
So, listen, you... you keep this,
all right? That's... yours.

743
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,334
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

744
00:56:26,443 --> 00:56:30,311
I'm... just... jumping up
and down on my bed.

745
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,414
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

746
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,010
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

747
00:56:40,023 --> 00:56:41,149
Right.

748
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,587
All right.

749
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:48,129
So, where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

750
00:56:48,231 --> 00:56:51,894
Oh, yeah? I-I-I ended up
having to go to, uh, New Hampshire

751
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,401
to help my cousin move.

752
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:56,438
You didn't bring
your cell phone?

753
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:59,269
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

754
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:04,677
No, I, uh, I-I forgot it. I, uh, ended up
leaving it here. So, you know...

755
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:07,147
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

756
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:07,783
Oh, yeah?

757
00:57:07,783 --> 00:57:10,815
We, uh, we almost
had a girl there.

758
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,352
- Republik?
- Yes.

759
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,884
Let's do it!

760
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,794
She is an eight.

761
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:33,575
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

762
00:57:33,676 --> 00:57:36,645
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

763
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:38,270
That's right.

764
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:43,084
But, if we win the 2.09,
I'm asking her out.

765
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:54,160
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only
owe eight bucks.

766
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,570
Hey. I... C-can I
get you a beer?

767
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:08,273
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

768
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:15,040
Uh, excuse me.
Can I get two Bud Lights?

769
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:16,577
Hey.

770
00:58:21,424 --> 00:58:23,289
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

771
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:24,883
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

772
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:27,059
Thank you.

773
00:58:33,236 --> 00:58:35,602
Are those your friends
over there?

774
00:58:39,175 --> 00:58:43,339
No. No, I've never seen them
before in my life.

775
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:47,510
Could you just excuse me
for... one second?

776
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:52,879
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

777
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:54,047
Yeah, we know.

778
00:58:54,157 --> 00:58:55,181
Yeah, well, can you not?

779
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,054
I think it's gonna freak
her out a bit, don't you think?

780
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,789
Yeah, I, uh, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

781
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:02,558
So, how do you know her?

782
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:06,157
Did you, like, take some self-help
seminar or something?

783
00:59:07,236 --> 00:59:08,294
What?

784
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:12,366
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

785
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:15,634
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

786
00:59:15,745 --> 00:59:18,839
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

787
00:59:18,948 --> 00:59:20,540
It's getting ridiculous.

788
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:24,211
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

789
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,787
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

790
00:59:25,888 --> 00:59:27,879
They let him,
and he does.

791
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:31,525
He ends up with, like,
two 19s and two 20s.

792
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,686
The dealer turns over a 17.

793
00:59:34,797 --> 00:59:36,526
It's soft. He needs
to take another card.

794
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:38,999
No. Don't say a four.
Is it a four?

795
00:59:39,102 --> 00:59:41,900
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. Ah, my God.

796
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:45,537
Not a great Christmas
that year.

797
00:59:48,077 --> 00:59:51,535
So, what does he think about
what you do? D-d-does he know?

798
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:54,276
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

799
00:59:56,853 --> 00:59:58,650
My dad's gone, too.

800
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:15,901
So, uh, you know, when you came
into the store to ask me to join the team,

801
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:18,400
was that because...

802
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:20,002
What?

803
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:23,676
Well, you know, was it
because... Micky asked you to?

804
01:00:26,816 --> 01:00:29,944
Look, we've had
three classes together.

805
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:33,922
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

806
01:00:34,023 --> 01:00:35,854
that nobody understood.

807
01:00:36,993 --> 01:00:41,191
You're the smartest person in every
single one of those classes, Ben.

808
01:00:41,297 --> 01:00:45,461
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

809
01:00:46,669 --> 01:00:48,603
Oh, wait, no, no,
not so much...

810
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:51,572
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

811
01:00:51,674 --> 01:00:54,108
It's not a problem.
- I-I don't know why I just did that.

812
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,438
- Don't apologize.
- Are-are you sure?

813
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:58,105
Yes. Um, shit,
this is-this my stop.

814
01:00:58,214 --> 01:01:00,614
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

815
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:03,413
But, really,
don't worry about it.

816
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,283
I... It's... I don't know, it's just
'cause we've been drinking, and...

817
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,881
It's just we're on a team,
we work together.

818
01:01:09,992 --> 01:01:12,426
- I-I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

819
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:13,127
- Okay.
- Okay.

820
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,923
Sure. Bye.

821
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:38,915
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

822
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:43,225
<i>I had saved
over 100,000 dollars.</i>

823
01:01:44,393 --> 01:01:46,452
<i>Only 200,000 to go.</i>

824
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:51,599
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

825
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,706
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

826
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:06,077
<i>the concept of
vectors and formulas</i>

827
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,878
<i>were replaced with
counting, shuffle tracking</i>

828
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:12,148
<i>knowing when to hit and
knowing when to color out.</i>

829
01:02:12,388 --> 01:02:14,982
<i>I was becoming
a pro on all levels.</i>

830
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:17,255
<i>I made more money
in one trip to Vegas</i>

831
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,764
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

832
01:02:25,134 --> 01:02:27,602
<i>In Boston, I was
just Ben Campbell.</i>

833
01:02:28,638 --> 01:02:32,369
<i>But in Vegas, I could be
anyone I wanted.</i>

834
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:34,773
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

835
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:38,142
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

836
01:02:38,247 --> 01:02:41,478
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

837
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:44,712
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

838
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:48,784
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

839
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:50,623
I may not be alone.

840
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:54,355
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

841
01:02:54,964 --> 01:02:56,363
There it is.

842
01:02:56,465 --> 01:02:59,957
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

843
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,201
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

844
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,337
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

845
01:03:10,046 --> 01:03:14,540
<i>It did get, well...
a little confusing sometimes.</i>

846
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:17,076
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

847
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:19,484
Ah, yeah, um, room service.

848
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:22,023
<i>Excuse me? Honey,
we don't do room service.</i>

849
01:03:22,124 --> 01:03:23,785
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

850
01:03:23,893 --> 01:03:26,259
<i>I mean, we don't
do room service.</i>

851
01:03:38,307 --> 01:03:40,969
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

852
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:49,843
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

853
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:02,764
<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

854
01:04:03,933 --> 01:04:05,491
<i>And he was right.</i>

855
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:11,531
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

856
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:13,336
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

857
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:17,469
Ah, there you go. All right, my night
just got better. Thank you, Joe.

858
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:21,414
<i>And it felt like it was
never going to end.</i>

859
01:04:31,794 --> 01:04:34,888
Clark? I got something
over here.

860
01:04:35,598 --> 01:04:37,293
Take a look at this.

861
01:04:39,802 --> 01:04:42,270
That guy? He's a kid.

862
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:46,102
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

863
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,574
Plus, he ordered
a tonic and lime.

864
01:04:48,678 --> 01:04:51,374
Tonic and lime.
What does that mean?

865
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,710
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

866
01:04:53,816 --> 01:04:57,115
Okay. So, is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

867
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,254
He's not running
a progressive system.

868
01:04:59,355 --> 01:05:02,552
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

869
01:05:02,658 --> 01:05:05,286
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

870
01:05:05,394 --> 01:05:06,554
You...

871
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:11,696
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

872
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:13,530
why are you still
consulting for us?

873
01:05:13,636 --> 01:05:15,103
I've been asking myself
the same thing.

874
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:18,640
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

875
01:05:19,075 --> 01:05:22,067
Bring up a frame of that
for me on the printer.

876
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:28,072
So, Terry, I heard you guys
are losing a lot of work

877
01:05:28,184 --> 01:05:31,210
to that biometric
facial recognition software.

878
01:05:32,788 --> 01:05:36,383
Just gives us a little bit
more time to focus on you guys.

879
01:05:38,928 --> 01:05:41,658
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

880
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:43,662
Here he is.

881
01:05:46,002 --> 01:05:49,062
I still think there're
bigger fish to fry out there.

882
01:05:49,171 --> 01:05:50,502
So do I.

883
01:05:58,381 --> 01:05:59,973
Hey, Fisher.

884
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,141
Ah, he's mad at me
and jealous of you.

885
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,742
But don't worry. Greatness evokes
that reaction sometimes.

886
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:07,789
Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

887
01:06:16,665 --> 01:06:18,633
- Hey.
- What's going on?

888
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:23,498
Ah, he... just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

889
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:25,233
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

890
01:06:25,341 --> 01:06:27,275
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

891
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,401
At least, I thought I was.

892
01:06:30,546 --> 01:06:32,138
Are you on drugs, Ben?

893
01:06:32,248 --> 01:06:34,182
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

894
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:36,217
No, no. Cam, I'm not
on drugs, okay?

895
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:39,082
I'll go to the meeting
if you need me to.

896
01:06:39,688 --> 01:06:42,418
Why didn't you tell me
you quit J. Press?

897
01:06:43,893 --> 01:06:45,326
I don't know.

898
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:48,025
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

899
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:51,860
What about Harvard?

900
01:06:53,335 --> 01:06:55,997
It'll find a way of
working itself out.

901
01:06:56,705 --> 01:06:59,299
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you.

902
01:07:11,587 --> 01:07:15,683
<i>I think the worst part of it
was... not being able to tell anyone.</i>

903
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:23,992
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

904
01:07:25,634 --> 01:07:26,760
Here you go, sir.

905
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:28,427
<i>And I liked it.</i>

906
01:07:29,138 --> 01:07:30,605
That's for you.

907
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:37,209
We just made two hundred
and ten... thousand dollars.

908
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:38,371
Yes.

909
01:07:38,481 --> 01:07:40,972
Now, Ben,
this is how we play!

910
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:46,053
<i>And play we did.</i>

911
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:52,385
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

912
01:07:52,495 --> 01:07:55,020
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

913
01:08:00,669 --> 01:08:03,502
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

914
01:08:03,606 --> 01:08:06,200
<i>gave Ben Campbell
a major upgrade.</i>

915
01:08:09,178 --> 01:08:12,045
<i>Dorm rooms turned into
high-roller suites.</i>

916
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:16,241
<i>Bicycles became
stretch limos.</i>

917
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:21,322
No, no!

918
01:08:24,627 --> 01:08:29,087
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

919
01:08:29,932 --> 01:08:33,834
<i>well, something
more... interesting.</i>

920
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:31,456
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- Uh, I-I'm from Boston.

921
01:09:32,728 --> 01:09:36,630
- On a convention?
- No, uh, business, actually.

922
01:09:38,834 --> 01:09:41,200
What line of work
you in, mister?

923
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:43,700
I-I count things.

924
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:47,466
My name's Sierra.

925
01:09:48,043 --> 01:09:53,276
Hi, Sierra. I'm, uh,
Salvador Sanchez.

926
01:09:55,284 --> 01:09:58,048
Would you like
a private dance, Salvador?

927
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:03,557
Well, that all depends on
how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

928
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:08,689
20 a song, 30-song minimum.

929
01:10:10,566 --> 01:10:12,158
Sounds expensive.

930
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:35,680
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

931
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:38,282
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

932
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:41,363
You are so lucky
you're cute.

933
01:10:41,463 --> 01:10:44,159
'Cause if you weren't cute,
I'd leave. You know that?

934
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:47,827
Jeffrey. My brother
from another mother.

935
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:49,496
How you doing? You good?

936
01:10:49,605 --> 01:10:52,802
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K. What,
are you back in town for business?

937
01:10:52,908 --> 01:10:58,039
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

938
01:10:58,947 --> 01:11:00,881
Oh, damn,
I forgot my ring.

939
01:11:00,983 --> 01:11:02,883
Oh, please.

940
01:11:09,658 --> 01:11:12,923
Oh, I don't wanna bet that.
That's for... that's for keep.

941
01:11:13,262 --> 01:11:14,957
100,000 going out.

942
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,994
Thank you, Jeffrey.

943
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,223
- Cole.
- Yeah.

944
01:11:27,223 --> 01:11:28,257
 Your boy's back.

945
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:33,839
That's him, right?
- There he is.

946
01:11:33,949 --> 01:11:36,975
And he brought a whole lot
more money with him.

947
01:11:44,126 --> 01:11:46,686
That is a hell of a suit,
by the way.

948
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:06,509
That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

949
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,887
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

950
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:19,689
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she, uh, signals him to come to the table.

951
01:12:21,096 --> 01:12:24,691
We don't use "tape" anymore,
old school. It's digital now.

952
01:12:27,102 --> 01:12:29,263
Never mind.
Terry, rewind it.

953
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:33,665
Okay, okay.

954
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,071
She's playing
the table minimum.

955
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:38,339
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

956
01:12:38,447 --> 01:12:42,315
She's gonna, uh, raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

957
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:46,420
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

958
01:12:46,522 --> 01:12:49,855
He comes to the table. I'm telling you,
they're working together.

959
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,016
Nice.

960
01:12:52,694 --> 01:12:55,254
Show me a computer
that can do that.

961
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:01,729
You look familiar.

962
01:13:03,038 --> 01:13:04,801
I know you, don't I?

963
01:13:06,408 --> 01:13:08,239
- I don't think so.
- No?

964
01:13:08,777 --> 01:13:13,043
Oh, sure, you look exactly like
that guy in Rain Man.

965
01:13:15,384 --> 01:13:18,217
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

966
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,015
Oh, yeah? No, I'd, uh...

967
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:24,786
The other one, the... What's his...
Uhhh... The retard.

968
01:13:25,794 --> 01:13:31,027
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

969
01:13:31,967 --> 01:13:33,901
You look just like that.

970
01:13:37,773 --> 01:13:44,645
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

971
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:47,242
could win so much.

972
01:13:49,618 --> 01:13:53,110
Hey, Jeffrey, his brother
from another mother,

973
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:54,985
how did that retard
win so much?

974
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:58,025
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

975
01:13:58,126 --> 01:14:00,321
Oh, I didn't mean it.

976
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,727
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

977
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,340
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

978
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,310
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

979
01:14:52,414 --> 01:14:55,872
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

980
01:14:55,984 --> 01:14:57,349
I understand, Ben.
We don't need any more...

981
01:14:57,452 --> 01:14:59,283
This is not the time. Okay?

982
01:14:59,388 --> 01:15:01,690
I wanna thank you for
confirming my choice in Ben.

983
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,226
- Sure.
- Now, go home.

984
01:15:10,032 --> 01:15:12,023
- What?
- You're off the team.

985
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:13,192
No.

986
01:15:14,202 --> 01:15:17,569
- I was-I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

987
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,104
I'm not leaving.

988
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,733
Yes, you are.

989
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:25,713
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

990
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:33,453
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

991
01:15:33,555 --> 01:15:36,683
So, I want you to pick up
the ticket and go home,

992
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:40,819
because if you don't, you know exactly
what I'm capable of doing,

993
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,727
don't you?

994
01:15:59,982 --> 01:16:00,971
All right, listen up.

995
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:04,610
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

996
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,587
That means we got less
than 24 hours to cash in,

997
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:09,953
or we're gonna be sitting with
200 grand of worthless plastic.

998
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:12,288
- So, we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

999
01:16:12,394 --> 01:16:16,296
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

1000
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:18,593
So, let's do it right now
before they can do that.

1001
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,668
Are you deliberately slow?

1002
01:16:21,503 --> 01:16:23,061
What about them?

1003
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:25,997
What about them?

1004
01:16:26,108 --> 01:16:30,408
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1005
01:16:37,853 --> 01:16:39,286
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1006
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:41,481
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1007
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,524
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1008
01:16:49,197 --> 01:16:51,256
I love a parade,
don't you?

1009
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:56,200
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1010
01:16:56,805 --> 01:16:58,033
"Genius".

1011
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:29,561
Hey, Kianna. Let me hold
your bag for a second.

1012
01:17:30,272 --> 01:17:31,534
Thanks, baby, here.

1013
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,130
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1014
01:17:33,241 --> 01:17:36,142
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1015
01:17:36,244 --> 01:17:37,233
Watch.

1016
01:17:37,345 --> 01:17:41,076
No, it's great, you just need a little, uh,
to get your knee a little higher.

1017
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:04,762
- Hi.
- Hey.

1018
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:08,575
So, the Hard Rock
comped me a suite.

1019
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:11,779
That's cool, that's great.

1020
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,545
You wanna see it?

1021
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:21,576
All right, take care, Bobby.
All right?

1022
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:43,594
God, it's cold.

1023
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:45,939
Hey, what time is it?

1024
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:50,071
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1025
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:53,538
Oh, look.
Here he comes.

1026
01:19:54,349 --> 01:19:56,340
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1027
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:57,679
Hey, Ben.

1028
01:19:57,953 --> 01:19:59,750
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1029
01:19:59,855 --> 01:20:02,016
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1030
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:03,488
Yeah, funny.

1031
01:20:04,793 --> 01:20:08,422
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1032
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:11,465
And you're sure you didn't inlay
the software on more space

1033
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:12,760
than the parameters suggest?

1034
01:20:12,868 --> 01:20:14,893
No. It's just one-fifth
of the free face.

1035
01:20:15,003 --> 01:20:16,994
Let's fire this mother up.

1036
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:18,367
Beautiful.

1037
01:20:27,215 --> 01:20:28,443
Okay.

1038
01:20:28,984 --> 01:20:30,076
Okay.

1039
01:20:33,588 --> 01:20:35,180
What's happening?

1040
01:20:38,526 --> 01:20:41,051
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1041
01:20:41,162 --> 01:20:42,424
No. What?

1042
01:20:43,498 --> 01:20:46,797
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1043
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,370
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1044
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:55,606
I can't believe this.
- I-I thought it was an-an 8K.

1045
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,302
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1046
01:20:57,412 --> 01:21:01,644
No, you didn't. You knew the entire
time the discrete was 16K.

1047
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,412
Damn it, Ben.

1048
01:21:03,518 --> 01:21:06,783
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1049
01:21:06,888 --> 01:21:10,289
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1050
01:21:10,392 --> 01:21:13,828
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was, uh, an honest mistake.

1051
01:21:16,464 --> 01:21:17,761
What?

1052
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:24,868
You know what? Um, I think we're gonna
have to go at this without you, man.

1053
01:21:25,974 --> 01:21:27,669
You-you're gonna what?

1054
01:21:30,512 --> 01:21:34,107
No, no. This is just
as much mine as it is yours.

1055
01:21:34,215 --> 01:21:36,809
We've been working on this
for over a year.

1056
01:21:36,918 --> 01:21:40,479
I know that. But your heart
just isn't in this anymore.

1057
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:47,819
You serious?

1058
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:55,560
Fine.

1059
01:21:57,405 --> 01:21:58,497
Fine.

1060
01:21:59,908 --> 01:22:04,140
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1061
01:22:04,245 --> 01:22:05,473
You know why?

1062
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,949
'Cause no one in the real world gives
a shit about the 2.09 Competition.

1063
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,917
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1064
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:15,012
to make yourselves
feel important.

1065
01:22:15,123 --> 01:22:17,023
You guys are pathetic.

1066
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,285
Thanks.

1067
01:22:25,266 --> 01:22:26,665
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1068
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:30,534
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1069
01:22:34,175 --> 01:22:37,167
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1070
01:22:37,278 --> 01:22:38,745
Nice to see you.

1071
01:22:38,847 --> 01:22:41,509
Anything I can do for you,
let me know.

1072
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:00,432
Double down.

1073
01:23:36,171 --> 01:23:39,197
I guess you play big
or you don't play at all.

1074
01:23:40,408 --> 01:23:41,636
Right?

1075
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:48,172
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1076
01:23:48,283 --> 01:23:51,081
Honey, we're actually
playing a game here.

1077
01:23:51,553 --> 01:23:52,645
Yeah.

1078
01:23:53,054 --> 01:23:54,817
Yeah, so,
you know what?

1079
01:23:54,923 --> 01:23:58,984
Why don't you run upstairs
and, uh, wait for me there? Okay?

1080
01:24:01,596 --> 01:24:03,427
All right. Let's go.

1081
01:24:08,603 --> 01:24:10,594
Yeah, all right.

1082
01:24:11,206 --> 01:24:13,800
I've got the worst
headache right now.

1083
01:24:27,822 --> 01:24:29,653
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1084
01:24:29,757 --> 01:24:32,123
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1085
01:24:32,227 --> 01:24:34,354
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1086
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:37,096
Twenty-one.

1087
01:24:43,538 --> 01:24:45,472
Pete, you're killing us.

1088
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,711
I guess it's not my night.

1089
01:25:25,517 --> 01:25:27,727
Are you out of your mind?

1090
01:25:28,393 --> 01:25:31,175
I, uh, I don't know
what happened.

1091
01:25:31,452 --> 01:25:34,080
I-I messed up.
I'm sorry.

1092
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:36,484
Oh, oh, you're sorry.

1093
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:40,186
Oh, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1094
01:25:40,295 --> 01:25:44,857
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1095
01:25:44,966 --> 01:25:49,027
So, we can all go back to being
friends and laughing over cocktails!

1096
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:51,603
Come on, Micky.
It can happen to anyone.

1097
01:25:51,706 --> 01:25:53,139
They get on a rush
and they lose control.

1098
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:54,868
You shut your mouth.
This is business.

1099
01:25:54,976 --> 01:25:58,343
Hey, I let you down,
all right? I get it.

1100
01:25:58,446 --> 01:26:02,280
Excuse me? You let me down?
I don't care!

1101
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:06,045
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1102
01:26:06,154 --> 01:26:09,180
You are not my friend.
This is a business.

1103
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:11,584
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1104
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:13,388
and, right now, it's not
worth a hell of a lot!

1105
01:26:13,494 --> 01:26:14,975
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1106
01:26:14,975 --> 01:26:18,094
No, no, no! I can't do that!
That money was for Harvard!

1107
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:20,099
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1108
01:26:20,201 --> 01:26:22,032
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1109
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:25,264
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1110
01:26:25,373 --> 01:26:29,309
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1111
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:34,683
Well, why aren't you
out there, then, Micky? Hmm?

1112
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:40,015
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1113
01:26:44,726 --> 01:26:46,660
This isn't about me,

1114
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:51,192
you arrogant little infant.

1115
01:27:04,112 --> 01:27:06,740
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1116
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:10,909
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1117
01:27:11,019 --> 01:27:13,010
And you damn well
know it.

1118
01:27:23,097 --> 01:27:24,587
I need a drink.

1119
01:27:27,435 --> 01:27:28,868
Anybody else?

1120
01:27:31,906 --> 01:27:33,635
Yeah, well,
we don't need him.

1121
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:35,402
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1122
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:38,172
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1123
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:41,544
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1124
01:27:42,116 --> 01:27:43,276
Why do we need him?

1125
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:44,476
Hey, you know what I think?

1126
01:27:44,585 --> 01:27:47,918
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1127
01:27:48,022 --> 01:27:49,421
No. No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1128
01:27:49,524 --> 01:27:51,754
I think we should go back
to Boston and figure this out.

1129
01:27:51,859 --> 01:27:53,656
Yeah, well, why don't we
let the team decide?

1130
01:27:53,761 --> 01:27:56,889
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1131
01:27:56,998 --> 01:27:58,989
And then he drove us apart.

1132
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,126
I mean, you saw how
he played Fisher against me.

1133
01:28:03,071 --> 01:28:06,700
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1134
01:28:08,209 --> 01:28:09,870
- Kind of.
- Really?

1135
01:28:10,645 --> 01:28:13,910
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1136
01:28:14,015 --> 01:28:15,512
All I'm saying is
that we try it.

1137
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:21,085
You know, if... we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1138
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:23,453
All of it.

1139
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:31,895
Okay.

1140
01:28:36,204 --> 01:28:37,262
Yeah.

1141
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:39,798
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:28:41,542 --> 01:28:42,736
Choi?

1143
01:28:44,112 --> 01:28:45,374
I'm in.

1144
01:28:47,248 --> 01:28:48,943
Now I need a drink.

1145
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:56,685
- What are you doing?
- What?

1146
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:58,759
What are you doing?

1147
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,919
Well, we're printing money.

1148
01:29:01,362 --> 01:29:04,058
What, you think just 'cause Micky
left we're gonna stop?

1149
01:29:04,165 --> 01:29:06,963
No, I could do this.
I can lead this team.

1150
01:29:07,335 --> 01:29:10,600
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1151
01:29:11,072 --> 01:29:13,302
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1152
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:16,436
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1153
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,536
when you first came into
the store to buy a tie?

1154
01:29:23,818 --> 01:29:27,057
What happened to
"300,000 dollars and I'm out"? Hmm?

1155
01:29:27,422 --> 01:29:30,118
What happened to
"A means to an end"?

1156
01:29:31,058 --> 01:29:33,891
How much do you have?
- What?

1157
01:29:33,995 --> 01:29:36,190
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1158
01:29:36,297 --> 01:29:38,527
Come on, Ben. How much do you
have saved back in Boston?

1159
01:29:38,633 --> 01:29:41,158
I've got 315 grand,
all right?

1160
01:29:41,536 --> 01:29:43,834
Then why are you still here?

1161
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:49,132
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1162
01:29:49,577 --> 01:29:51,442
So does everybody else.

1163
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:54,542
So, come on, Jill.
Are you in?

1164
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:03,185
You are the big player, Ben.

1165
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:04,656
Yes, I am.

1166
01:30:07,094 --> 01:30:08,994
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1167
01:30:36,924 --> 01:30:38,858
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1168
01:30:39,894 --> 01:30:42,260
You have been
most accommodating.

1169
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:44,798
All right, that's for you.

1170
01:30:45,099 --> 01:30:47,397
Okay, take care.
Hey, good luck.

1171
01:30:54,976 --> 01:30:56,967
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1172
01:31:08,289 --> 01:31:11,690
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1173
01:31:15,296 --> 01:31:17,423
Just got an interesting call.

1174
01:31:19,534 --> 01:31:23,595
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1175
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,940
I don't know about that.

1176
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:35,014
This is Cole.

1177
01:31:44,562 --> 01:31:48,591
Ahh, queen of diamonds.
Your lady luck tonight.

1178
01:31:49,096 --> 01:31:50,723
You're doing good.

1179
01:31:51,032 --> 01:31:52,795
You're a real winner.

1180
01:31:57,572 --> 01:32:00,268
Sometimes.
Just like everybody else.

1181
01:32:01,342 --> 01:32:03,537
Now, why don't I believe that?

1182
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:07,705
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1183
01:32:07,815 --> 01:32:10,477
Yeah, I bet it's been
that way your entire life.

1184
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:14,351
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1185
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:17,455
I'd split them.

1186
01:32:17,558 --> 01:32:21,995
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1187
01:32:28,803 --> 01:32:30,896
Kianna. I think we have
a serious problem over there.

1188
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:32,472
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1189
01:32:32,573 --> 01:32:35,633
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1190
01:32:35,743 --> 01:32:37,472
I think we need to call
security or something.

1191
01:32:37,578 --> 01:32:41,173
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1192
01:32:45,786 --> 01:32:47,754
Let's take a walk, huh?

1193
01:32:48,489 --> 01:32:52,255
Come on, kid. See if we can't
get you that chicken dinner.

1194
01:32:57,431 --> 01:33:00,025
It's called, uh,
biometrics.

1195
01:33:00,134 --> 01:33:04,366
Biometrics. It's sort of like,
uh, a fingerprint of your face.

1196
01:33:07,008 --> 01:33:12,241
See, when the player sits down at
the table, the software, it reads this, uh...

1197
01:33:12,346 --> 01:33:13,813
Biometric profile.

1198
01:33:13,914 --> 01:33:15,677
... biometric profile
of your face,

1199
01:33:15,783 --> 01:33:18,809
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1200
01:33:22,356 --> 01:33:27,157
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1201
01:33:30,331 --> 01:33:31,628
All right.

1202
01:33:35,773 --> 01:33:40,071
Ohh! You understand
all this. You go to MIT.

1203
01:33:40,441 --> 01:33:41,840
Smart boy.

1204
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:45,244
My name is Cole Williams.

1205
01:33:45,846 --> 01:33:49,111
And if I ever see you
in this town again,

1206
01:33:49,884 --> 01:33:53,285
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1207
01:33:54,522 --> 01:33:56,513
and then I will kill you.

1208
01:34:01,195 --> 01:34:04,756
Please. Please,
just take the money.

1209
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,524
You can take it.

1210
01:34:10,237 --> 01:34:11,568
Tell me, uh,

1211
01:34:12,139 --> 01:34:16,872
how's... good old
Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1212
01:34:18,546 --> 01:34:23,142
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky,
we go way back.

1213
01:34:24,251 --> 01:34:27,243
I spent years, chased him
all over this town.

1214
01:34:27,688 --> 01:34:32,648
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1215
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,728
He was very persistent.

1216
01:34:35,629 --> 01:34:38,928
And then, one September night,

1217
01:34:39,433 --> 01:34:42,334
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1218
01:34:43,204 --> 01:34:46,640
my casino was taken
for seven figures.

1219
01:34:46,741 --> 01:34:48,072
Can you imagine that?

1220
01:34:48,175 --> 01:34:51,406
The most ever taken by
a single counter in one night.

1221
01:34:51,512 --> 01:34:56,108
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1222
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,582
Funny thing, though.

1223
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:03,513
I never saw Micky Rosa
after that.

1224
01:35:04,692 --> 01:35:05,818
Never.

1225
01:36:32,546 --> 01:36:34,673
Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study

1226
01:36:34,782 --> 01:36:38,809
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1227
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,217
And was concerned with developing

1228
01:36:41,322 --> 01:36:46,191
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1229
01:36:47,595 --> 01:36:49,028
Any questions?

1230
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:51,557
No? All right, moving on.

1231
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,593
Isn't it true Cauchy
stole from his students?

1232
01:37:01,508 --> 01:37:05,376
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1233
01:37:06,413 --> 01:37:10,941
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1234
01:37:12,086 --> 01:37:16,318
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1235
01:37:18,392 --> 01:37:20,257
stole their hard work.

1236
01:37:22,963 --> 01:37:25,659
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1237
01:37:25,766 --> 01:37:30,465
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1238
01:37:30,571 --> 01:37:33,506
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1239
01:37:33,607 --> 01:37:36,940
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1240
01:37:37,044 --> 01:37:39,512
and publishing it
under a pseudonym.

1241
01:37:41,348 --> 01:37:43,009
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1242
01:37:43,117 --> 01:37:47,110
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1243
01:37:47,221 --> 01:37:49,246
And, you know,
it's a real shame,

1244
01:37:49,356 --> 01:37:53,554
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1245
01:37:53,661 --> 01:37:55,390
this was the dispute,

1246
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:02,426
if he'd been able to... get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1247
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:06,201
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1248
01:38:06,307 --> 01:38:09,333
and they could have
done great things together.

1249
01:38:09,743 --> 01:38:13,804
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1250
01:38:15,516 --> 01:38:17,177
You should get
that eye looked at.

1251
01:38:54,388 --> 01:38:55,787
You okay?

1252
01:38:58,759 --> 01:39:00,386
Everything's gone.

1253
01:39:02,196 --> 01:39:04,790
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1254
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:09,130
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1255
01:39:11,005 --> 01:39:13,098
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1256
01:39:13,207 --> 01:39:15,607
I-I-I gotta find a way
to get it back.

1257
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,400
Are you insane?

1258
01:39:19,013 --> 01:39:22,574
You just got the shit kicked out
of you and you won't let this go!

1259
01:39:22,683 --> 01:39:26,619
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1260
01:39:27,388 --> 01:39:28,878
Look, please...

1261
01:39:30,691 --> 01:39:32,955
I don't wanna lose you, too.

1262
01:39:35,963 --> 01:39:39,558
Ben, you were
dragged away in Vegas.

1263
01:39:40,234 --> 01:39:44,568
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1264
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:46,500
I know.

1265
01:39:47,474 --> 01:39:48,634
I know.

1266
01:39:55,983 --> 01:39:58,781
You know, I'm so sorry
that I hurt you.

1267
01:40:00,587 --> 01:40:01,952
I'm sorry.

1268
01:40:04,825 --> 01:40:09,319
In Vegas, I don't know
what happened. That wasn't me.

1269
01:40:10,531 --> 01:40:12,158
Look, you know me.

1270
01:40:12,866 --> 01:40:14,731
You know what I'm like.

1271
01:40:16,537 --> 01:40:18,027
You know me.

1272
01:40:24,478 --> 01:40:26,343
I need you to trust me.

1273
01:40:27,681 --> 01:40:31,048
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1274
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:37,420
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Connolly and Kazazi!</i>

1275
01:41:14,795 --> 01:41:17,764
That's it. That's...
that's the story.

1276
01:41:20,267 --> 01:41:22,497
Jill Taylor. Really?

1277
01:41:23,303 --> 01:41:26,795
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1278
01:41:26,907 --> 01:41:31,105
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.

1279
01:41:31,211 --> 01:41:35,944
Yeah, you did.
But... you had a life experience.

1280
01:41:40,387 --> 01:41:42,378
I-I can't believe
how I treated you, Miles.

1281
01:41:42,489 --> 01:41:46,391
You know, you're my best friend,
and I... really let you down.

1282
01:41:47,261 --> 01:41:50,355
I really let you down.
I'm sorry.

1283
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:56,694
And I'm-I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's... that's great.

1284
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,539
- Jill Taylor, really?!
- Yeah.

1285
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:05,169
So, let me get
this straight.

1286
01:42:05,846 --> 01:42:09,009
Money, girls,

1287
01:42:10,184 --> 01:42:14,587
high-roller suites,
clubs, Vegas.

1288
01:42:15,789 --> 01:42:20,817
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1289
01:42:24,364 --> 01:42:25,729
So, we cool?

1290
01:42:27,367 --> 01:42:28,959
Yeah, we're cool.

1291
01:42:29,469 --> 01:42:32,165
But you better believe that you're
gonna make this up to me big time.

1292
01:42:32,272 --> 01:42:33,534
All right.

1293
01:42:34,841 --> 01:42:36,968
So, what are you
gonna do now?

1294
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:29,592
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1295
01:43:29,696 --> 01:43:32,062
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1296
01:43:32,165 --> 01:43:34,565
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1297
01:43:40,774 --> 01:43:41,741
What?

1298
01:43:41,842 --> 01:43:45,972
Look, I... I've... I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1299
01:43:47,848 --> 01:43:49,338
I want back in.

1300
01:43:50,317 --> 01:43:54,185
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1301
01:43:56,056 --> 01:43:59,253
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1302
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,523
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1303
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:07,327
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1304
01:44:07,434 --> 01:44:11,894
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1305
01:44:12,873 --> 01:44:14,841
With this facial
recognition software,

1306
01:44:14,941 --> 01:44:18,138
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1307
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:22,342
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1308
01:44:22,449 --> 01:44:27,580
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1309
01:44:29,089 --> 01:44:34,391
Well, you know, that's... that's why I was
thinking maybe you should be the other big player.

1310
01:44:35,796 --> 01:44:39,129
You know,
two big players playing big?

1311
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:43,633
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1312
01:44:48,075 --> 01:44:49,667
But Fisher's out.

1313
01:44:50,544 --> 01:44:54,913
No one else on the team
can... be the big player, can they?

1314
01:44:58,151 --> 01:45:01,552
And if we do well,
if we do really well,

1315
01:45:02,322 --> 01:45:05,485
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1316
01:45:06,493 --> 01:45:09,018
and I might even
get that sabbatical.

1317
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:14,490
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1318
01:45:16,436 --> 01:45:19,132
Just went back to
the head of the class.

1319
01:45:20,407 --> 01:45:22,272
I gotta go be social.

1320
01:45:27,647 --> 01:45:30,946
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1321
01:45:31,051 --> 01:45:33,918
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1322
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:37,514
But the return...
is gonna be the biggest.

1323
01:45:38,825 --> 01:45:42,261
Now, they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1324
01:45:42,496 --> 01:45:44,464
And we can't mess around.

1325
01:45:44,831 --> 01:45:46,298
I'm glad you're
back with us, Micky.

1326
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,300
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1327
01:45:48,402 --> 01:45:51,894
and not prove to Ben that
I can do more than just teach.

1328
01:45:52,739 --> 01:45:56,641
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1329
01:45:56,743 --> 01:45:59,803
and tonight
we forget about the past.

1330
01:46:00,046 --> 01:46:01,911
We just focus on the future.

1331
01:46:02,015 --> 01:46:05,348
Right. This is our last time.

1332
01:46:05,752 --> 01:46:08,778
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1333
01:46:08,889 --> 01:46:11,221
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1334
01:46:14,694 --> 01:46:16,594
Let's go make a killing.

1335
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:18,495
All right.

1336
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:43,088
Let's see what we can do with this.

1337
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:56,260
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1338
01:46:57,938 --> 01:47:00,065
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1339
01:47:00,173 --> 01:47:04,633
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1340
01:47:16,289 --> 01:47:18,450
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner! There it is.

1341
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:21,994
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1342
01:47:22,796 --> 01:47:26,095
And, Jim, I might
even love you.

1343
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:38,104
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1344
01:47:52,125 --> 01:47:53,183
What's your name?

1345
01:47:53,293 --> 01:47:56,421
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1346
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:58,760
There you go,
give me it all.

1347
01:48:08,808 --> 01:48:10,002
There you go.

1348
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:14,542
Thank you. Thank you.

1349
01:48:19,286 --> 01:48:21,516
Such a shame, Shane!

1350
01:48:22,489 --> 01:48:24,548
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1351
01:48:24,658 --> 01:48:28,992
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1352
01:48:29,095 --> 01:48:31,188
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1353
01:48:44,511 --> 01:48:46,035
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1354
01:48:46,146 --> 01:48:48,808
This never happens,
this never happens.

1355
01:49:01,861 --> 01:49:03,658
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1356
01:49:03,763 --> 01:49:05,321
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1357
01:49:05,432 --> 01:49:06,566
- Split tens!
- Again!

1358
01:49:06,566 --> 01:49:07,294
- Split tens!
- Again!

1359
01:49:30,223 --> 01:49:33,192
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1360
01:49:34,427 --> 01:49:36,292
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1361
01:49:36,396 --> 01:49:39,297
Come on,
just give me the chips!

1362
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:43,529
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1363
01:49:43,637 --> 01:49:46,197
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1364
01:49:46,306 --> 01:49:49,366
Nice to see you.
Have a good night, darling.

1365
01:49:54,914 --> 01:49:56,211
This way!

1366
01:50:07,427 --> 01:50:08,519
Go.

1367
01:50:22,876 --> 01:50:24,241
This way!

1368
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:32,141
Come on, Jill.
Come on!

1369
01:50:42,062 --> 01:50:44,656
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1370
01:50:44,764 --> 01:50:47,631
Give me the chips,
I'll meet you at Fox's.

1371
01:50:53,707 --> 01:50:55,299
Go, go, go, go!

1372
01:51:06,252 --> 01:51:07,913
Come on, come on.

1373
01:51:11,024 --> 01:51:12,582
Move, move, move!

1374
01:51:16,763 --> 01:51:18,025
Come on.

1375
01:51:19,165 --> 01:51:20,757
Go, go, this way.

1376
01:51:32,746 --> 01:51:34,577
All right, let's go.

1377
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:45,146
Go, go, go, go!
Airport!

1378
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:05,337
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa
after that.</i>

1379
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:11,678
Oh, God.

1380
01:52:12,786 --> 01:52:15,050
But I think
I wanna see him now.

1381
01:52:16,122 --> 01:52:18,590
And I want you
to make that happen.

1382
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:25,296
I-I don't work
for Micky anymore.

1383
01:52:28,301 --> 01:52:29,734
Come on, kid.

1384
01:52:31,571 --> 01:52:35,337
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1385
01:52:36,376 --> 01:52:38,310
But I will give you
one night.

1386
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:41,471
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1387
01:52:42,382 --> 01:52:46,148
You'll make a killing,
and you'll keep it all.

1388
01:52:49,222 --> 01:52:50,416
Listen.

1389
01:52:51,991 --> 01:52:53,458
My name's Cole.

1390
01:52:55,028 --> 01:52:56,552
Cole Williams.

1391
01:52:58,464 --> 01:53:00,864
You just bring me
Micky Rosa, kid.

1392
01:53:01,167 --> 01:53:03,192
I'll take care of the rest.

1393
01:53:05,738 --> 01:53:08,673
Son of a bitch.

1394
01:53:51,317 --> 01:53:53,080
Who the hell are you?

1395
01:54:15,942 --> 01:54:19,105
Ben. Good job.

1396
01:54:20,179 --> 01:54:25,242
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1397
01:54:25,451 --> 01:54:27,544
It's gonna
work out for you.

1398
01:54:29,122 --> 01:54:30,680
So, that's it?

1399
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:34,889
- That's it.
- All right.

1400
01:54:35,862 --> 01:54:37,557
Oh, dr. Campbell?

1401
01:54:38,898 --> 01:54:41,867
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1402
01:54:42,201 --> 01:54:44,101
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1403
01:54:44,203 --> 01:54:48,105
And I been chasing Micky Rosa
around here for too damn long.

1404
01:54:49,342 --> 01:54:51,606
I'm looking at
some retirement.

1405
01:54:53,513 --> 01:54:54,980
Leave the bag.

1406
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:59,348
No. No, no, no, no.

1407
01:54:59,452 --> 01:55:03,946
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1408
01:55:04,057 --> 01:55:09,051
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1409
01:55:09,162 --> 01:55:10,891
'cause you're smart.

1410
01:55:12,465 --> 01:55:16,993
So, you're gonna
leave the bag.

1411
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:26,637
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1412
01:55:35,488 --> 01:55:37,285
I knew you were smart.

1413
01:55:56,142 --> 01:55:58,872
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1414
01:55:58,978 --> 01:56:01,037
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1415
01:56:01,547 --> 01:56:04,675
<i>And I have
a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1416
01:56:04,784 --> 01:56:07,252
<i>I thought I had
my life mapped out.</i>

1417
01:56:09,155 --> 01:56:10,247
<i>But then I remembered</i>
